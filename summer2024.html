                <h1>About My Employer</h1>
                <p>Over the past 4 months, I had the opportunity to work for 1296869 Ontario Limited. Established in 1998, the company has been doing custom software development for over 25 years, 
                    initially using the Microsoft development stack, and recently transitioning to the Microsoft Azure cloud environment. 1296869 Ontario Limited specializes in developing business 
                    applications for clients, employing a variety of tools such as C#, Microsoft DevOps, SQL, and other technologies.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="job-description">
                <h1>My Job</h1>
                <p>Throughout this term, I focused primarily on learning to create web pages using Razor Pages. Recently, I started a new project for a client, which is currently ongoing. My task 
                    was to develop a webpage that displays data about agents within different organizations. During this project, I learned how to sort lists using LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) 
                    and how to implement sliders to adjust widget sizes dynamically. I also learned the importance of attention to detail, as small mistakes such as having a slightly different 
                    PartitionKey in table storage and placing correct LINQ commands in the wrong location, can completely mess up your code. These experiences taught me both technical skills and 
                    problem-solving techniques essential to web development.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="container">
            <h1>Goals</h1>
            <div class="goals">
                <h2>Goal #1</h2>
                <p>My first goal was to gain experience with creating web applications. Over the course of this term, I used razor pages a lot to create web applications to store different kinds of data. I
                    learnt how to implement dropdowns, and filters, use sorting tools to organize data from tables, use resource files to change the language of my web page dynamically, and use AJAX
                    (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) for asynchronous data retrieval. Overall, I believe that I exceeded this goal, as I was able to learn more about using razor pages for web applications
                    than I had originally expected.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="goals">
                <h2>Goal #2</h2>
                <p>My second goal was to learn and understand about cloud technologies. During this term, I worked with Azure Storage, a cloud-based solution that allowed me to store and manage data for my 
                    projects. I learnt how to connect my web application to Azure Storage tables and display the data dynamically on the web pages. Additionally, I explored APIs (Application Programming
                    Interfaces), specifically working with RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer), and used it to retrieve data which was passed on to my web application. Overall, I believe that I
                    was able to meet this goal, as I now have a much better understanding of cloud technologies and how to use them in my projects, and I am looking forward to deploying my web application
                    to Azure App Service next term.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="goals">
                <h2>Goal #3</h2>
                <p>My third goal was to improve my efficiency in problem-solving and debugging. During this term, I encountered numerous bugs while running my programs. I learnt how to find the source of the
                    bugs by setting breakpoints, and running the code line by line to find any malfunctions. Although sometimes I would have to research what to do if I was stuck, I was able to learn about why
                    the bug occurred, and how to avoid it in the future. In addition to the bugs, I also faced design challenges. For example, I had a dropdown of different cities, however they were ordered
                    based on their ID value, which resulted in a random order. I learnt how to sort the dropdown alphabetically using LINQ (Language Integrated Query) making the feature more user friendly.
                    Overall, I believe that I was able to meet this goal, as I have more experience with how to solve bugs and design challenges more easily.</p>

        <div class="reflection-container">
            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <p>This co-op term has been a valuable experience, allowing me to apply my academic knowledge in a real-world setting. Working on various projects has enhanced my technical skills and 
                given me insights into the challenges and nuances of software development. I've learned the importance of thorough testing and debugging, as well as the value of clear communication 
                within a team. Overall, this term has contributed significantly to my growth as a software engineer and has prepared me for future roles in the industry, an I am excited for what is
                come next semester!</p>
